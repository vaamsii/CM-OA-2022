# 2022 CM Internship Menu Exercise

# Demo

It's currently on the code sandbox: https://codesandbox.io/s/2022-internship-exercise-menu-forked-hd8jv9?file=/src/index.js

# Work / Project Examples

** Provide up to three examples of work/projects that youâ€™ve recently participated in and provide detailed information about your role and contributions to the project. **

### Radar

I am currently working with Radar and I working on front end as mobile developer. I have also done Ui/Ux mockups for Radar. The mobile application is built on Flutter framework and dart language on the front end. It is my first time working with flutter and I have learned a lot about flutter framework as well the Dart lanugage itself. It is also my first time working with a MVC design pattern. Where integrating the front end with back end using APIs, then creating functions in the frontend based of the backend code. Then creating the screens which output to the users different actions using those functions.

### trashSort

This is one of my favourite projects I have done, as it was the first MLH Hackathon I have won. I have won York Engineering Competition before for programming, but that was more so timed and required more so an prototype and judging was done based of the engineering design principles. However, trashSort project was done within 24 hours and it is a full fledged product, although there are few more iterations that can be done for a market release. I enjoyed working on this project as it involved both hardware and software aspects, almost as if it's a good representation of my Computer Engineering degree. I have worked on the arudino and the front end portion of the project. I have also hooked up the arudino to the existing full stack web application using axios library within Node.Js backend. One the front end we used, React.js and I have also done Ui/ux for the screen.

### Dominarlo

This was a great work experience working in a small team and creating a educational game for Dr. Sherif Elbdrad. Developed the application using React.js, learnt most of the React.Js skills from this experience, as well as Css ones. Understanding existing code was a challenge, as it wasn't structured properly as well as wasn't using good naming conventions. However, after understanding the exisiting code, it helped me understand javascript lanugage even better.

# Inspiration

** Provide up to three examples of work that has recently inspired you from a technical perspective. These can be open source projects, CodePens/CodeSandboxes, blog posts, etc. Be sure to include specifics on what you found inspiring. **

### AssistBuddy

I found this project pretty cool after partcipating in yuHacks hackathon. I thought the topic of mental health and helping people with their mental health is amazing. Technologically they used 3D art on top of building an application it was amazing, considering the time given.

### ac-unsubscribr

I found this project very helpful myself, as I have been also facing this issue of unwanted subscriptions I have done past that I want to subscribe. I chose this project to talk about here mainly due to the fact that simple problems can be projects which can appeal to wider audience and sometimes in such comeptitions like Hackathons can be deciding factor in terms of winning and losing. It kind of also helped me realize that problem you are solving doesn't have to be huge, however the way its implemented and presented to others is important. That is where you earn brownie points.

### PotHead

I found this project very inspirational and it is related to trashSort project that I did before. I think knowing where potholes are on a map before you drive on a certain road, can be very helpful as a driver. This one I like idea but moreso the technology. The way they encorporated accelerometer and intel edison board then connect it to python then output it to users using flask. Just thought the whole flow of the program from a high level perspective is amazing. There is a lot of good usecases for this project.

# Focus

** If you were given the time and resources to build/learn anything you wanted during your first 6 months at CM, where would you choose to focus your efforts? Provide a brief description of how you would spend your time. **

https://www.criticalmass.com/work/detail/nissan-leaf

I found the above past project which critical mass did very cool and would love to work on something similar. I just found the zero emissions dashboard of the Nissan Leaf pretty cool. I really believe such project would further expand my skills in Html and Css as well as JavaScript as it seems there were a lot of cool actions for the dashboard as well. 

https://www.criticalmass.com/work/detail/citibank

I also found this above past project pretty cool as I am currently working with Radar as a front-end mobile developer, mobile development as well as web development for me either are good platforms to work on. Or even PWA (progressive web applications) which are a hybrid between web and mobile applications, essentially PWAs are cross-platform. I am currently learning the basics of PWAs and I have done few projects on them, below I have a link of one. I wouldn't mind also working on mobile development projects or PWA related ones. For mobile development projects, like this one with citibank, althought I haven't have any experience in swift, I would love to learn it.
